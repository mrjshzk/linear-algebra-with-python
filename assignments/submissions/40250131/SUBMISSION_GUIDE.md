# Submission Guide

Follow these steps to submit your assignments via GitHub.

Reference: `assignments/ASSIGNMENTS.tex` contains the full assignment specification.

## 1. Create your folder

Inside `assignments/submissions/`, create your folder using the pattern:

```
40XXXXXX
```

Replace `XXXXXX` with exactly six digits (e.g., `40250001`).

## 2. Add your work

Place your assignment files and notebooks inside your folder. Keep the structure clear and include both languages (assignments 01–07):

```
assignments/submissions/40XXXXXX/
  README.md
  .gitkeep
  SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md
  01/
    README.md
    python/
    javascript/
    reflexao.md
  02/
    README.md
    python/
    javascript/
    reflexao.md
  ...
```

## 3. Create a branch

Create a branch per assignment (example for assignment 01):

```bash
git checkout -b 40XXXXXX-A01
```

## 4. Commit your changes

From the repository root:

```bash
git add assignments/submissions/40XXXXXX/01
git commit -m "submit: 40XXXXXX A01"
```

## 5. Push your branch

```bash
git push origin 40XXXXXX-A01
```

## 6. Open a Pull Request

Open a PR against the default branch:

- Title: `Submission 40XXXXXX --- A01`
- Description: confirm both Python and JavaScript deliverables are included

## 7. Update if requested

If changes are required, make new commits to the same branch and push again.

## Tooling reminders

- Python: run from `packages/python` with `poetry run ...`.
- JavaScript: run from `packages/js` with Yarn (Node.js 20+).
